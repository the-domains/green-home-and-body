I will be talking about the 7 ways to boost your

**confidence**

in a series of articles. If you have never heard of the "Confidence Circle" then now is your time. The confidence circle consists of Clarity, Courage, Community, Commitment, Celebration, Capability, and finally Confidence. You can use the term the "7 C's". Get it......The Seven Seas....HA! Just thought I would put that in.

Confidence is a key component to any person's success. When a person's confidence is low, it is almost certain they will not be successful in many of their ventures.

Have you ever known a person that has low confidence and complains about things not going right for them? Well I have, and let me tell you this person would go on and on about never getting their big break and constantly complains about others passing them on the corporate ladder.

The main objective is to help you build confidence and give you a proven way to accomplish that goal. Once you get your confidence up and learn to avoid fear, the road to success will be so much easier. 

Never again will you second guess your actions. You will have the blue print to confidence as well as the blue print to success.

How many successful people you know that are not confident......I will wait. There is any and most will tell you that you can't be afraid to take chances to be sure in your ability on anything you want to pursue.
