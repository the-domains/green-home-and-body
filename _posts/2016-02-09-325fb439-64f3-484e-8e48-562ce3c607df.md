2010 - 2020 Will be known as "The Great Wellness Transformation" decade.

Futurist David Houle Coined this decade as the Transformation Decade back in 2010\.

But many analysts are further defining it.  

They are dubbing it, the "Great Wellness Transformation Decade."  There has been a considerable increase in focus around a proactive approach to health and wellness.

In this country for example, we have seen the largest shift in health care policy we have ever seen.   This change is creating economic ripples and HR policy changes across all industries.   We have seen some of the largest retailers of tobacco (drug stores) drop them as they attempt to shift our minds towards the drugs store as a healthy place to go... often times calling themselves wellness stores and utilizing wellness marketing strategies.   Wellness is one of the largest industries for growth, in fact the Euro Monitor has Identified it as NUMBER 2 in the Top 10 Global Consumer Trends[(1)][0].  Wellness centers, once only found on the west coast are showing up in every town on the eastern seaboard and everywhere in between.  There has been a shift in traditional professions as well. Think of your chiropractor, once known for back cracking and realignment are morphing their business models into complete wellness solutions providing a lot of holistic advice.  Heard of a new Yoga studio opening up lately?   

**THERE IS A GREAT REASON FOR ALL OF THIS!!!**

* **The Boomer Affect** -- 76 million are aging and don't like it.  They don't want drugs as the first solution and are demanding more holistic answers.
* **ObamaCare**: Employers now know the burden/expense of unhealthy employees.  FACT: $1 spent on proactive, preventative wellness SAVES $3 in healthcare treatment.
* **The Internet: **The average consumer is wanting to be more knowledgeable about Holistic options.  The challenge becomes sifting through the abundance of information on the internet vs what is fact.  The scare tactic days are fading.  **Food Babe Exposed**:[(2)][1]

It sounds to me that the Great Wellness Transformation is a logical name for this decade and the trends toward convenient wellness shopping will continue.   Have you changed your eating habits in the past couple of years?  Do you feel that proactive living will continue to be a trend in the consumer world that will make big noise?  Would you like to participate in that aspect of the economy?
